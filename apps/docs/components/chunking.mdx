## Document Chunking

Chunking is the process of breaking down documents into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces:

- **Semantic Chunking**: Create chunks based on content meaning rather than arbitrary size
- **Structure-Aware**: Respect document structure like headings, paragraphs, and sections
- **Content Preservation**: Maintain the context and relationships between chunks
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Add metadata to chunks for improved retrieval

## Why Chunking Matters

Effective chunking is critical for:

## Chunking Strategies

Agentset employs intelligent chunking strategies:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Semantic Chunking">
    <img
      className="block mx-auto"
      src="/images/ProgressIndicator.png"
      alt="Semantic Chunking Diagram"
      width="70%"
    />
    
    Semantic chunking creates chunks based on the meaning and natural divisions in content:
    
    - **Topic Detection**: Identify natural topic boundaries in text
    - **Semantic Coherence**: Ensure each chunk contains semantically related content
    - **Context Windows**: Maintain appropriate context windows for each chunk
    - **Hierarchical Structure**: Preserve nested relationships between content sections
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Structure-Based Chunking">
    Structure-based chunking uses document structure to guide the chunking process:
    
    - **Heading-Based**: Create chunks based on section headings
    - **Paragraph-Based**: Use paragraphs or groups of related paragraphs as chunks
    - **List Items**: Process list items as individual chunks or groups
    - **Tables**: Handle tables as structured data chunks
    
    This approach works well for well-structured documents like technical documentation, reports, and scholarly papers.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid Chunking">
    Hybrid chunking combines multiple approaches for optimal results:
    
    - **Structure Priority**: Use document structure when available
    - **Semantic Fallback**: Apply semantic chunking when structure is insufficient
    - **Size Constraints**: Apply size limits to ensure processability
    - **Overlap Strategy**: Create overlapping chunks to preserve context
    
    This balanced approach works well across varied document types and ensures consistent retrieval quality.

## Chunking Configuration

When creating a namespace, you can configure chunking behavior:

```javascript
const namespace = await agentset.namespaces.create({
  name: "Technical Documentation",
  description: "Contains technical documentation and guides",
  options: {
    chunking: {
      // Chunking strategy: "semantic", "structure", or "hybrid"
      strategy: "hybrid",
      // Target chunk size (in tokens)
      targetSize: 1000,
      // Chunk overlap (in tokens)
      overlap: 200,
      // Preserve headings with content
      preserveHeadings: true,
      // Keep sections together when possible
      preserveSections: true,
      // Keep lists together when appropriate
      preserveLists: true,
      // Special handling for tables
      tableStrategy: "as_unit",
    }
  }
});
```

## Advanced Chunking Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hierarchical Chunking">
    Hierarchical chunking creates multiple levels of chunks:
    
    - **Parent Chunks**: Larger document sections (chapters, major sections)
    - **Child Chunks**: Smaller subsections within parent chunks
    - **Relationship Tracking**: Maintains parent-child relationships between chunks
    
    This approach enables:
    - More precise retrieval by targeting specific granularity levels
    - Better context preservation by accessing parent chunks when needed
    - Improved navigation of document structure
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Metadata-Enhanced Chunks">
    Each chunk is enhanced with metadata to improve retrieval:
    
    - **Position Metadata**: Where the chunk appears in the document
    - **Structural Metadata**: Heading hierarchy, section info, etc.
    - **Content Type**: Text, table, list, code block, etc.
    - **Named Entities**: Important entities mentioned in the chunk
    
    This metadata helps the retrieval system find more relevant chunks based on query context.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Dynamic Chunking">
    Dynamic chunking adjusts chunk size and strategy based on content:
    
    - **Content-Aware Sizing**: Use smaller chunks for dense technical content, larger for narrative
    - **Format-Based Adaptation**: Different strategies for different document types
    - **Query-Time Adjustment**: Adjust chunking based on query characteristics
    
    This adaptive approach ensures optimal processing across diverse document collections.

## Custom Chunking Rules

Enterprise customers can define custom chunking rules:

```javascript
// Define custom chunking rules for specific document types
await agentset.namespaces.setChunkingRules({
  namespaceId: namespace.id,
  rules: [
    {
      // Apply to legal contracts
      documentType: "legal",
      // Use structure-based chunking
      strategy: "structure",
      // Keep clauses together
      preserveClauses: true,
      // Special handling for definitions
      definitionsStrategy: "separate_chunk",
    },
    {
      // Apply to financial reports
      documentType: "financial",
      // Custom chunking for financial tables
      tableStrategy: "semantic_rows",
      // Preserve footnotes with references
      preserveFootnotes: true,
    }
  ]
});
```

These custom rules ensure optimal processing for domain-specific documents.
