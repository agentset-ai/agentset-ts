# Authentication

All Agentset API endpoints require authentication using an API key.

## API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate your requests to the Agentset API. You can obtain an API key from the Agentset dashboard.

## Using Your API Key

To authenticate your API requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.agentset.ai/v1/namespace \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## API Key Security

Your API key grants access to your Agentset resources, so keep it secure:

- Never share your API key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or blog posts
- Use environment variables or secret management tools to store your API key
- Periodically rotate your API keys to enhance security

## Token Security

Bearer tokens should be transmitted only over HTTPS (TLS).
