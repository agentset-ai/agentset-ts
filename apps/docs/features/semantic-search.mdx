## Advanced Semantic Search

Agentset's semantic search capability goes beyond keyword matching to understand the meaning behind queries and documents:

- **Semantic Understanding**: Captures the intent and context of queries
- **Contextual Relevance**: Identifies truly relevant content, not just keyword matches
- **Multi-Vector Search**: Combines multiple embedding strategies for better results
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Blends semantic and keyword-based approaches

## How Semantic Search Works

Agentset uses advanced embedding models to convert text into vector representations that capture semantic meaning:

1. **Document Embedding**: Documents are processed and embedded during upload
2. **Query Understanding**: User queries are analyzed for intent and context
3. **Vector Similarity**: The system finds documents with similar vector representations
4. **Re-ranking**: Results are refined based on multiple relevance factors
5. **Contextual Retrieval**: The most relevant passages are extracted from matching documents

## Embedding Models

Agentset uses state-of-the-art embedding models to represent text:

## Search Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid Search">
    Agentset combines semantic search with traditional keyword-based methods for optimal results:
    
    - **BM25 Algorithm**: Proven keyword-matching algorithm enhanced with semantic understanding
    - **Lexical Matching**: Identify exact terms and phrases when needed
    - **Adaptive Weighting**: Dynamically adjust the importance of semantic vs. keyword matching
    
    This hybrid approach ensures you get the benefits of semantic understanding while still finding exact matches when appropriate.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Contextual Retrieval">
    Instead of returning entire documents, Agentset retrieves the most relevant passages:
    
    - **Passage Identification**: Locates specific sections that answer the query
    - **Context Preservation**: Includes surrounding context for better understanding
    - **Multi-passage Synthesis**: Combines information from multiple passages when needed
    
    This focused approach ensures more precise answers and better citation of sources.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Search Filters">
    Refine search results with metadata filters:
    
    - **Document Type**: Filter by file format or document category
    - **Date Range**: Limit results to specific time periods
    - **Author/Owner**: Find documents by specific creators
    - **Custom Metadata**: Filter using your own document metadata fields
    
    Combine these filters with semantic search for highly targeted results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Direct Search API

In addition to agent-based queries, you can directly access Agentset's semantic search capabilities:

```javascript
// Perform a semantic search across documents
const searchResults = await agentset.documents.search({
  agentId: agent.id,
  query: "renewable energy market growth projections",
  options: {
    // Number of results to return
    limit: 10,
    // Minimum similarity score (0-1)
    minScore: 0.7,
    // Include document metadata
    includeMetadata: true,
    // Filters
    filters: {
      // Only documents from the last year
      dateRange: {
        after: new Date(Date.now() - 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
      },
      // Only specific document types
      documentTypes: ["pdf", "docx"],
    }
  }
});

// Process search results
for (const result of searchResults.results) {
  console.log(`Document: ${result.document.title}`);
  console.log(`Score: ${result.score}`);
  console.log(`Passage: ${result.passage}`);
}
```

## Customizing Search Behavior

You can configure how search works for your agents:

```javascript
const agent = await agentset.agents.create({
  name: "Research Agent",
  description: "Analyzes market research documents",
  options: {
    search: {
      // The embedding model to use
      embeddingModel: "agentset/text-embedding-v2",
      // Whether to use hybrid search (combine semantic and keyword)
      useHybridSearch: true,
      // Weight of semantic vs. keyword matching (0-1)
      semanticWeight: 0.7,
      // Default number of results to retrieve
      defaultResultLimit: 20,
      // Whether to enable passage-level search
      enablePassageSearch: true,
      // Length of passages for retrieval
      passageLength: 500,
    }
  }
});
```
