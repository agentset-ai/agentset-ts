## What is Agentic RAG?

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) takes traditional RAG to the next level by incorporating intelligent agent capabilities:

- **Planning**: Breaking complex queries into sub-questions for comprehensive answers
- **Evaluation**: Verifying results against source documents for accuracy
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Performing multiple retrieval and reasoning steps to build deeper understanding
- **Self-correction**: Revising approaches based on intermediate results for better outcomes

## How Agentset Improves RAG

Traditional RAG systems simply retrieve relevant documents and generate answers based on those documents. Agentset's Agentic RAG approach takes this further:

1. **Query Planning**: The agent analyzes the user query and determines what information is needed
2. **Strategic Retrieval**: Instead of a single retrieval step, the agent can make multiple targeted retrievals
3. **Answer Synthesis**: The agent combines information from multiple sources to create a comprehensive answer
4. **Citation Generation**: Sources are accurately cited so users can verify information
5. **Self-Verification**: The agent checks its answer against source documents for accuracy

## Example: Agentic RAG vs. Traditional RAG

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Complex Query Example">
    **Query:** "How did our Q1 sales in Europe compare to Q4 last year, and what factors contributed to the change?"
    
    **Traditional RAG:**
    Would try to find documents that specifically mention both Q1 Europe sales and Q4 sales. If such a direct comparison doesn't exist in the documents, the answer will be incomplete or inaccurate.
    
    **Agentic RAG:**
    1. Plans to first find Q1 Europe sales data
    2. Then separately retrieves Q4 sales data
    3. Performs a comparison calculation
    4. Searches for factors that may have influenced the change
    5. Synthesizes a comprehensive answer with all supporting evidence
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reasoning Example">
    **Query:** "Based on our financial reports, should we increase investment in our Asia-Pacific division?"
    
    **Traditional RAG:**
    Might retrieve documents about Asia-Pacific performance, but would struggle to make a reasoned recommendation based on financial principles.
    
    **Agentic RAG:**
    1. Retrieves relevant financial data about Asia-Pacific division
    2. Identifies key performance metrics
    3. Compares with other divisions and industry benchmarks
    4. Considers growth trends and market conditions
    5. Provides a reasoned recommendation with supporting evidence
  </Accordion>

## Using Agentic RAG

Agentset's agentic capabilities are built into the chat functionality. When having a conversation with your documents:

```javascript
const response = await agentset.chat({
  namespaceId: namespace.id,
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "How did our Q1 sales in Europe compare to Q4 last year?" }
  ],
  options: {
    // Enable detailed reasoning steps in response
    includeReasoningSteps: true,
  }
});

// Access the reasoning steps
console.log(response.reasoningSteps);
```

## Customizing Agentic Behavior

You can customize the agentic RAG approach when creating a namespace or during chat:

```javascript
// Configure when creating a namespace
const namespace = await agentset.namespaces.create({
  name: "Financial Reports",
  description: "Contains financial reports and analysis",
  options: {
    // Configure retrieval behavior
    retrieval: {
      // Number of documents to retrieve in each step
      docsPerRetrieval: 5,
      // Maximum number of retrieval steps
      maxRetrievalSteps: 3,
    },
    // Configure reasoning behavior
    reasoning: {
      // Whether to enable multi-step reasoning
      enableMultiStep: true,
      // Whether to verify answers against sources
      verifyAnswers: true,
    }
  }
});

// Or configure during chat
const response = await agentset.chat({
  namespaceId: namespace.id,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Analyze our Q1 performance" }],
  options: {
    agentic: {
      // Whether to enable agentic RAG features
      enabled: true,
      // Maximum time to spend on deep research
      maxProcessingTime: 60, // seconds
    }
  }
});
```
