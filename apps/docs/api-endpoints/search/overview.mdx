# Search

The Search functionality in Agentset allows you to perform semantic searches across your documents within a namespace, returning the most relevant results based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Find results based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Relevance Scoring**: Results ranked by relevance to your query
- **Context Retrieval**: Get document context for each search result
- **Namespace Scoping**: Search within specific namespaces

## Available Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [Search](/api-reference/search) | Perform a semantic search across documents in a namespace |

## API Documentation

For detailed API specifications, see the [Search API Reference](/api-endpoints/search/api-reference).

## Getting Started

To begin searching your documents, use the [Search](/api-reference/search) endpoint with a query against one of your populated namespaces.
