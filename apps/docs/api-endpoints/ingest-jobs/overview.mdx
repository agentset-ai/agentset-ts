# Ingest Jobs

Ingest Jobs in Agentset are the processes that import, parse, and index your documents. They handle the transformation of raw data into searchable content within your namespaces.

## Key Features

- **Automated Processing**: Upload documents and let Agentset handle the rest
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the progress of document ingestion
- **Batch Processing**: Ingest multiple documents in a single job
